	<br>1. In high school because MTJJ was relatively dull, his classmates named Mu Tou(means dull in chinese), so he took a net name called “Mu Tou”, but because Mu Tou had a higher repetition rate, he added “JJ”
	  </br>


	<br>2. MTJJ originally studied art design, and later joined an animation company, so he embarked on the path of no return to animation production.
	  </br>
	
	<br>3. MTJJ once adopted a stray cat called "XiaoHei", and later the animation "The Legend of Hei" was born.
